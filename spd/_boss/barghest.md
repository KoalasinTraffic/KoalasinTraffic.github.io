The barghest feasts upon its allies, growing its size and gaining their health. This fast moving boss will stop in its tracks to eat when there is a nearby [regular enemy](/spd/enemy). It consumes a multiplier of its current health and increases the barghest's max health.

Take advantage of its feasting time and try to defeat preceding waves before allowing this one to spawn.

Feast multiplier: 2x

Feast duration: 2 seconds

Health: 110%

Movement Speed: 143%
