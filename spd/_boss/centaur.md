# Centaur Boss

The centaur leads an army to destroy your base. Periodically, the centaur stops in its tracks and rallies more forces. Three mini-centaurs are spawned with a percentage of the main centaur's health. The mini-centaur is essentially a [basic enemy](/spd/enemy/peasant) but gives only 1 money and deals 1 damage to the player base.

* Mini-centaur health: 6% of boss's max health

* Spawn frequency: 11 seconds

* Health: 150%

* Movement speed: 77%

* Damage to player base: 10 HP
