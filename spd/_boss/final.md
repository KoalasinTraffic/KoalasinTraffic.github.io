# Final Boss

The final boss is an enigma spawned by the sacrifice of all the enemy small people. Its stats are intentionally unbalanced, and items do 5 times less damage than they do normally.

* Health: 400%

* Movement Speed: 50%

* Damage to Player Base: 100 HP (instant death)

# Multiple Stages

There are 4 stages of this boss that are repeated every minute. Every time a stage is changed, the final boss will suck in towers, displacing them from their grid shape.

1. Fire Stage
* The final boss will spawn 3 fire orbs over a period of 11 seconds.
* If not destroyed by the player, each orb will deal 2 HP of AOE damage to towers in a random nearby location every 3 seconds.

2. Ice Stage
* The final boss will freeze the player for 6 seconds.

3. Swap Stage
* The final boss will swap two random towers 12 times every second.

4. Drain Stage
* The final boss will take 10% of the player's current money 6 times every second.
