# Architect Character

The architect builds towers at a much higher health. This durability is effective against enemies that deal damage.

Also, displacement effects are nullified. This means your towers can't be pushed by the [Dragon](/spd/boss/dragon) and the [Final Boss](/spd/boss/final)!

Regular tower health = 100%

Architect tower health = 200%
