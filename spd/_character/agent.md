# Agent Character

The agent helps the enemy by spawning more [Serfs](/spd/enemy). Although waves will be slightly more challenging, more enemies mean you can earn more money!

Enemy health calculations are not affected by the extra money players receive from these extra serfs.

Regular serfs = Spawned at a regular interval of every 3 seconds

Agent serfs = One more serf is spawned at the beginning of each wave
