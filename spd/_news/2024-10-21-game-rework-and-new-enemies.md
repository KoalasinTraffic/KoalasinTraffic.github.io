# Game Rework and New Enemies

The full release has been announced to be November 6th! I'm excited to finally put closure on this game, and many unpatched fixes have been added. New content including four new enemies and a new map is now live. And a complete rework on health and damage calculations has been added to balance the game.

All planned features are now complete, so future updates will only have bug fixes. Expect a sale on the release date of November 6th!

Controller changes
* The speed up and rotating camera buttons have been swapped, so arrows are used for all camera controls. Sorry for any confusion this can cause.
* Fixed bug where right analog stick would invert.

Upgrade changes
* You can now buy weapon charges (in addition to the 8 charges you can grab around various maps).
* Costs of early upgrades lowered and costs of later upgrades increased.

Weapon balancing
* The grab weapon now grabs ALL enemies in range.
* The strike weapon will no longer prevent movement and interval between strikes are shortened.
* The trap weapon has been buffed to deal 10% damage per second (instead of 5%).
* The blaze weapon charge will be dropped every 10 waves instead of 5.

Enemy balancing
* Wave health calculations have been completely reworked, so higher difficulties will grant more cash and points.
* Income health has been reduced by ~70%.
* Getting 5 stars on levels is now much harder.

Character changes
* Selection of your character is not just aesthetic anymore. Small variations have been added, which are described in the Character Select menu.
* Cost of buying new characters have been lowered.

Towers changes
* There will be tower variations every 10 levels until 100. Then, variations will occur every 100 levels until 700.
* One tower of each type can be leveled to 777, which will be extremely powerful and have special bonuses. (Though this will be nearly impossible to reach)
* Tower costs balanced (fire cheaper, slow cheaper, and beam more expensive)
* Beam tower has been nerfed because it was massively overpowered. Max number of beams limited to 6.
* Stun tower traps can no longer stun.
* Selling towers can no longer give full value (sell amount is now rounded down instead of up).

Enemy changes
* 4 brand new enemies have been added!
* Griffin will now spawn the healing egg less frequently and the number of eggs are capped at 20.
* Enemy healing and speed buffs will no longer be applied to bosses.

Map changes
* A new 5th map and its variants have been added!
* The costs of levels have been increased. However, all players who played before v1.0 will have everything unlocked.
* The order of levels have been reorganized. Scores are jumbled around, so I apologize for those who got high scores for them.
* Tutorials have been reworked and allow players to preview all maps.
* Build locations on various maps have been fixed.

Gameplay
* All levels are now "endless" by default. Hardest difficulty has ~2000 waves and easy levels can have up to 4000 waves. (The previous limit was ~600 waves).
* Default camera view is now lower to look more like 3rd person. The top down view now moves with the camera.
* You can now rush all enemies at once, but will reset when the number of enemies reach over 100. You can now also stop rushing all waves.
* Mazing bugs with enemy navigation have been fixed with the tower rework.

Miscellaneous
* Towers can now be built when jumping or standing on top of other towers.
* Music can be changed while playing using R3 or Tab. Song info shows at the bottom right of the screen.
* Game will now autosave high score and points every 10 minutes.

Performance
* Lowered quality of enemy textures and meshes to improve performance.
* Reduced tick frequency for expensive calculations.
* Overall performance has been improved, but issues with having too many towers and enemies at the same time still exist.
