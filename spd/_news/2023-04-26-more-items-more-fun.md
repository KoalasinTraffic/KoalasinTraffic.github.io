title: Update v0.3 More Items More Fun

# More Items! More Fun!

Most players could not find the hidden items, leaving them with only 1 per level! This limits the clutch factor and the amount of fun, so I have added 2 more easy to find items per map (max of 7). For the completionists, I put the locations of all items on my website.

The menu interface has been improved so players have the option of skipping levels. Prompts have been updated, level overlay option is added, and there is now an option to reset prompt history.

Lastly, I added 4 more achievements that can be completed by simply entering the tutorial and entering each of the mazing levels. Other details below.

Major bug fixes
* Dynamic shadows and burning enemy particles were causing flashing lights. This has been fixed.
* Fixed issue where you would sometimes get twice the score and money from defeating a single enemy.
* To my knowledge, the fatal error crash has been resolved.

Features
* Settings menu has more options. The default value for always showing tower level will be off.
* Character visual upgrades can be made earlier now. They are intentionally expensive so players will get them later.

Prompts
* Star threshold info screen updated to be more clear.
* Prompts have been updated to help new players. Rereading them by clearing the prompt history may be useful for existing players too.
* In summary, I want players to know that rushing waves gives a lot more points, and that you're free to skip levels to see later content if desired.

Level changes
* Tutorial waves have been modified so first time players are able to see every enemy type. I am hoping this will pique the interest of new and existing players.
* Cost of unlocking levels has been increased slightly. Mazing levels are no longer free.
* New challenge level added. More coming in the future.
* I named the levels after seasons so its easier to differentiate.

Balance changes
* Evolved basic tower buffed.
* Evolved pierce tower buffed.
* Item strike damage buffed.
* Stun tower bonus damage to bosses nerfed.
* Max tower level changed to 14 (for those playing endless mode).

Website
* The Small People Defense official website has been updated to reflect the latest patch. Tons of details have been added.
