# Update v0.6 Brand New Weapons!

The concept of items have been completely reworked into a new weapon system. Alongside items you've already unlocked, your character can pickup a charge of the "Blaze" weapon every 5th wave. And there's a brand new weapon called "Grab" that allows you to hold onto your enemies and even throw them off the map!

Because I updated the unlock locations on a couple maps, all 7 charges for Blaze, Grab, and Buff will be automatically unlocked for people who played Update v0.5 or earlier! This reward will remain permanent to handle legacy save files.

Blaze weapon
* Bomb has been renamed to "Blaze" and has been reworked to attack in a single direction.
* Blaze does damage as particles go forward and attacks 5 times.
* It is possible to hit the same unit twice, but requires a bit of luck.
* Charges for Blaze are not permanently unlocked anymore, instead players start with only one charge.
* Now every 5th wave, an enemy will drop a muffin that grants another Blaze charge when picked up.

Grab weapon
* Grab picks up the closest, non-boss enemy when used.
* Barbarians who have been grabbed will have their invulnerability automatically removed.
* Grab weapon charges are now found in the Autumn map in the same locations as cabbages.

Trap weapon
* Poison has been renamed to "Trap" and is now a placeable trap that triggers a 6 second stun on the first enemy it touches.
* Bosses are still not affected by stuns.
* Poison is still emitted but with half the damage and half the radius.

Buff weapon
* Buff duration has been doubled.
* Buff unlock locations have been moved to the Summer map.

Strike weapon
* Strike now disables input during its duration but attacks faster.

Character
* Added visual weapons to the hand to make it easier to tell which weapon is selected. Build mode has a mesh attached to the hand as well.
* Added animation to swapping of weapons and to usage of the Strike weapon.
* Moved camera position to center on player.

Map
* Changed invisible walls of base and spawn so they can be walked on.
* Removed long grass on Autumn maps and replaced them with shorter ones for better tower visibility.

Towers
* Mesh sizes increased for stun tower visual attachments.
* Pierce tower renamed to "Beam" tower.

UI
* Gameplay speeds has been changed to x1, x2, x3, and x4. Previously max speed was only x3.
* Added coin sound when defeating a wave enemy.
* Added explicit text of "wave" in top bar.
* Added statistic tracking of weapon usage and Grab weapon unlocks.
* Many prompts have been changed to reflect weapon changes.

Rewards
* Lastly, players who update their game gets an extra 1000 points. Thanks for sticking around^^
