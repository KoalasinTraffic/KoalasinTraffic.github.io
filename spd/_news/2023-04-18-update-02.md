# Update v0.2

There have been a number of bugs in the first Early Access release, one of which was a fatal error. Because of this, I am pushing this update now and will continue to hotfix until players stop getting this crash.

Fatal Error Fix
* Several protections have been added to prevent the "Fatal error!" crash. For some reason, I cannot reproduce this problem but players are getting it consistently. I believe the source may be caused when an enemy is being accessed even though it has been destroyed. Please be patient when dealing with this crash and please report it if it persists.

Minor Bug Fixes
* Fixed inconsistency with pierce tower's line before building when towers are equidistant between two tether points.
* Fixed bug where you were able to toggle build/item mode while holding an object when hovering over an interactable object.

Minor Level Change
* Changed tutorial to enable all 6 towers (previously 5 were enabled) to demonstrate what can be used in later levels.

Reward
* I'm giving all players who played v0.1 an extra 3000 points to save your grinding time. I've also stored all the users who played Small People Defense so far, and those players will get a badge in the future.
