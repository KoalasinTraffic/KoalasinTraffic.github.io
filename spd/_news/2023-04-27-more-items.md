# More Items!

I noticed that most players could not find the hidden items, leaving them with only 1 per level! This limits the amount of options and fun, so I have added 2 more easy to find items per map. For the completionists, I put the locations of all items on my website.

The menu interface has been improved so players have the option of skipping around. Prompts have been updated, level overlay option is added, and prompt history reset option is added.

Lastly, I added 4 more achievements that can be completed by simply entering the tutorial and each mazing level. Other details below.

Major Bug Fixes
* Dynamic shadows and the burning enemy particles were causing flashing lights. This is fixed.
* Fixed issue where you can get twice the score and money from defeating a single enemy.
* Fatal error crash has been resolved. (Please let me know otherwise!)

Features
* Option to always show the tower level has been added to the Settings menu. Its default value will be off.
* Option to clear the prompt history has been added to the Settings menu.
* Character visual upgrades can be made earlier now. Priced high so players will get them last.

Prompts
* Prompts have been updated to help new players. Rereading them by clearing the prompt history may be useful for existing players as well.
* Basically, I want players to know that rushing waves gives a lot more points, and that you're free to skip levels to see later content if desired.
* Star threshold scores updated to be more clear.

Level Changes
* The tutorial waves have been modified so first time players are able to see every enemy type. I am hoping this will pique the interest of new and existing players.
* The cost of unlocking levels has been increased slightly. Mazing levels are no longer free.

Balance Changes
* Evolved basic tower buffed slightly.
* Evolved pierce tower damage buffed slightly.
* Item strike damage buffed slightly.
* Stun tower bonus damage to bosses nerfed slightly.
