# Early Access Release

Along with a second trailer and new steam images, Small People Defense is live with early access! The decision to release as early access was driven by the lack of play testing. As thorough as I tried to be, there will likely be bugs and balance issues that I've missed.

The game currently features 25 levels, 4 biomes, 6 towers, 6 bosses, and 11 enemy types. For the power ups, there are 10 tiers for both DPS and cost for each tower. And there are 30 tiers for starting health and starting money. The current roadmap of the game is to add more levels!

Currently, the website is not complete. I will gradually be adding documentation on how to unlock all the items along with other info for those who want to finish everything in the game. Hopefully I can add more frequent updates as we get more players.
