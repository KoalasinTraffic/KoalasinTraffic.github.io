# New Map and Tower Rework

Towers now have some additional abilities to make leveling up at lower levels more beneficial. This will hopefully make it more interesting for new players. Additionally, a brand new map has been released in beta mode!

Several quality of life changes have been made (huge thanks to Siopilos). Also, several minor bugs have been fixed.

Sandbox mode
* New sandbox map has been released!
* You can select the starting difficulty and modifier for this mode.
* You can pick which enemies and how many to fight per wave.
* You can choose the enemy pathing before starting the level.
* Cost to play the map will range from 200 to 800 points. This mode is intended for late game players.
* Currently, this mode will be available immediately after the tutorial, but will be subject to change.

Basic tower
* Starting at level 2, the basic tower will fan additional arrows to the side with 1/6th of the main arrow's damage.
* Level 2 will have one fanning arrow, level 3 will have two fanning arrows, and etc.
* The maximum number of arrows will be at level 7, with three on each side of the main arrow.
* At level 8, the additional damage for further projectile travel still stay for the main arrow.

Splash tower
* Radius of splash has been increased from the previous update.
* Starting at level 2, cannonballs will bounce if they hit an enemy. Each bounce will deal 75% damage of the previous and will have a 25% radius reduction.
* Level 2 can bounce twice, level 3 can bounce three times, and etc.
* At level 8, the radius of the splash will not drop off when bouncing.

Fire tower
* The burning effect will now spread to a nearby enemy if the target dies with remaining burn times.
* Also, burn times have been increased significantly and will be based on level. Balancing changes may be done in future hotfixes or updates.
* Level 1 will have a burn time of 2 seconds.
* Level 4 will have a burn time of 3 seconds.
* Level 7 will have a burn time of 4 seconds.
* Level 8 will have a burn time of 5 seconds.

Stun tower
* If the stun tower does the finishing blow, it will now spawn a trap.
* This trap will strike the first enemy that steps over it for 100% of the original damage, potentially stunning the enemy if it is burning and slowed.
* At level 8, the stun tower will still chain to a second enemy with 25% damage.

Beam tower
* The beam will redo its tether connections on each level up. This will change the strategy significantly.
* Level 2 will attempt to connect to two other towers, level 3 will attempt to connect to three other towers, and etc to a maximum of eight beams.
* Past level 8, leveling up the beam tower will still redo its connections.
* Because of these buffs, the purchase of the beam tower will no longer be refunded.
* Also at level 8, damage per second has been reduced from 20% to 16% for those inside it.

Input changes
* Respawning has been changed to be in the main menu instead of holding the jump button.
* Holding the upgrade button will now attempt to reach level 8 first. If it's already 8 or higher, holding upgrade will attempt to reach level 14.

Map changes
* Difficulty of hard maps have been reduced significantly.
* Easter egg in the Spring maps have been removed due to a teleportation bug.
* Invisible walls in the Spring and Winter maps have been removed as it was confusing on where the player needs to jump.

Miscellaneous changes
* Music in the tutorial level has been changed.
* Picking up muffin charges should now be possible even when defeating the enemy in its spawn.
* Fixed issue where stunning the enemy resets the enemy's movement speed.
* Fixed statistic tracking of grab weapon.
* Fixed bug with the "money loss" text remaining after animation is done.

Rewards
* Like before, players who update the game will get 1000 points.
* Before full release, I plan on adding a badge for players who reached a high score in early access. More to come in the future. Cheers.
