After a week's worth of work, I finally finished my first trailer. Along with a new logo, all graphics are now in [the steam store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239870/). My goal is to get 100 wishlists before releasing at the end of 2023!

Making this trailer took a lot more time than expected and is definitely a lesson that marketing is half the battle in game development. Although Small People Defense is very playable at this point, I'm adding a nice buffer time and plan to release after 2 years of development.

The trailer highlights the main gameplay experience and features two completed maps. I'm planning on creating a total of four maps, each with six different variations.
