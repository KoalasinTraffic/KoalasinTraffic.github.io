# Allow 100% Completion

I've decided to change the legacy achievement to be auto-completed by simply opening up the game! I've also renamed the achievement to reflect those changes, so all new players will be able to get 100% of the achievements now.

I'm still working on tower changes, but it'll take me a bit of time due to being busy with my personal life. Stayed tuned in a month or so for a new major patch.
