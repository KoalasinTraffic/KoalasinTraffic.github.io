title: Website Launch
---

The first official launch of my website is live! This site will serve as the landing ground for news, patches, and the most up-to-date information related to Small People Defense.

After spending over a year developing my first game, the wiki page is finally born. I'm a solo developer and a complete novice when it comes to game development and building a website. Please let me know if there are any issues on my [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/dND7Z4b63p)!

This website's source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/KoalasinTraffic/koalasintraffic.github.io). Everything is powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
