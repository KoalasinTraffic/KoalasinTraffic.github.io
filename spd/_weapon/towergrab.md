# Relocate and Rebuild

This weapon allows you to grab your towers and rebuild them in a different location! While being held, a tower is temporarily. There is also a short delay before being enabled once placed.

There is no limit on how many times a tower can be rebuilt. Only the [Beam](/spd/tower/beam) tower cannot be grabbed.

Regular rebuild time: 2 seconds

[Magician rebuild time](/spd/character/magician): 1 second
