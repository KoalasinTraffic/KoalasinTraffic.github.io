# Knight Enemy

The knight gains armor depending on the number of allies near it. Each point of armor will reduce the amount of damage taken.

For example, with one nearby enemy, all damage taken by the knight is reduced by half. With 2 nearby enemies damage is reduced by a third. With 3 nearby enemies damage is reduced by 4, and so on.

* Health: 100% / (n*(n+1)/2) where n is the number of knights spawned

* Movement speed: 50%

* Damage to player base: 2 HP
