# Stun Tower

The best combo tower in the game.

* Single damage: A lightning strike immediately deals damage to its target.

* No projectile: Lightning strikes instantly and does not miss.

* Stun effect: Struck enemies will be stunned if and only if the enemy is already slowed and burning. If these conditions are met, bonus damage based on the stun tower's strength will be dealt and all status effects (including invulnerability) will be removed.

* AI: Targets slowed and burning enemies first.
