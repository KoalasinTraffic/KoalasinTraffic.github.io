# Stun Tower

The best stunning tower in the game.

* Single damage: A lightning strike immediately deals damage to its target.

* No projectile: Lightning strikes instantly and does not miss.

* Stun effect: Struck enemies will be stunned for 1 second if and only if the enemy is already slowed and burning. If these conditions are met, bonus damage will be dealt and invulnerability can be removed. Damage will be x2 for regular enemies and x4 for bosses.

* AI: Targets slowed and burning enemies first.

After evolving, the stun tower will have a second chain lightning after each attack. The chain lightning does 25% of the original's damage.
