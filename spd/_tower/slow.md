# Slow Tower

The best slowing tower in the game.

* Single damage: A magic bolt is shot and deals damage to the first target it hits.

* Fast projectile: This tower shoots much faster projectiles and usually does not miss.

* Slow effect: Struck enemies will have their movement speed slowed. If slowed by towers of different strengths, the stronger slow will persist and its duration will be refreshed.

* AI: Targets burning enemies and focuses it until out of range.

After evolving, the slow tower will deal area of effect (AoE) slow and damage on impact. Damage is spread evenly among the number of enemies hit.
