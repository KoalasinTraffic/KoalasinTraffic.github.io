# Slow Tower

The best slowing tower in the game.

* Single damage: A magic bolt is shot and deals damage to the first target it hits.

* Fast projectile: This tower shoots much faster projectiles and usually does not miss.

* AI: Targets burning enemies and focuses until out of range.

* Slow effect: Struck enemies will have their movement speed slowed. If slowed by towers of different strengths, the stronger slow will persist and its duration will be refreshed.
  * Base slow: 15%
  * Additional slow per level: 5%
  * Maximum slow amount: 50%

Starting at level 10, the slow tower will deal area of effect (AoE) slow and damage on impact. Damage is spread evenly among the number of enemies hit. Every 10 additional levels will increase the splash radius until a maximum radius at level 70.
