# Slow Tower

The best slowing tower in the game.

* Single damage: A magic bolt is shot and deals damage to the first target it hits.
  * Starting at level 10, this tower will deal area of effect (AoE) slow and damage on impact. Damage is spread evenly among the number of enemies hit.
  * At level 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700, the splash radius will increase.

* Fast projectile: This tower shoots much faster projectiles and usually does not miss.

* AI: Targets burning enemies and focuses until out of range.

* Slow effect: Struck enemies will have their movement speed slowed. If slowed by towers of different strengths, the largest slow will persist and its duration will be refreshed.
  * Base slow: 14%
  * Additional slow per 10 levels until 100: 3%
  * Additional slow per 100 levels until 700: 5%
  * Slow at level 700: 75%

At level 100, this tower will gain 20% range.

At level 777, the slow tower will become invulnerable, have significantly increased splash radius, and have significantly greater slow (70%).
