# Slow Tower

The best slowing tower in the game.

* Single damage: A magic bolt is shot and deals damage to the first target it hits.

* Fast projectile: This tower shoots much faster projectiles and usually does not miss.

* AI: Targets burning enemies and focuses until out of range.

* Slow effect: Struck enemies will have their movement speed slowed. If slowed by towers of different strengths, the stronger slow will persist and its duration will be refreshed.
  * Base slow: 10%
  * Additional slow per level: 5%
  * Maximum slow amount: 80%

At level 8, the slow tower will deal area of effect (AoE) slow and damage on impact. Damage is spread evenly among the number of enemies hit.
