# Fire Tower

The best damage over time (DoT) tower in the game.

* Single damage: A single arrow is shot and deals damage to the first target it hits.

* Slow projectile: Arrows can and will miss, so be sure to place your towers accordingly.

* AI: Targets enemies that are not burning first.

* Burn effect: Hit enemies takes additional burning DoT. If burned by towers of different strengths, the largest burn damage will be used for DoT and its duration will be refreshed for its maximum amount.
  * At level 1, burn time is 2 seconds.
  * At level 4, burn time is 3 seconds.
  * At level 7, burn time is 4 seconds.

At all levels, the burn effect can spread when the target dies only if there's a close enemy nearby and if there's still remaining burn time on the dying target.
