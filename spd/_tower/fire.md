# Fire Tower

The best damage over time (DoT) tower in the game.

* Single damage: A single arrow is shot and deals damage to the first target it hits.

* Slow projectile: Arrows can and will miss, so be sure to place your towers accordingly.

* Burn effect: Struck enemies will take additional burning damage over time. If burned by towers of different strengths, the largest burn damage will be used for DoT and its duration will be refreshed.

* AI: Targets enemies that are not burning first.
