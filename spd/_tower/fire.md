# Fire Tower

The best damage over time (DoT) tower in the game.

* Single damage: A single arrow is shot and deals damage to the first target it hits.

* Slow projectile: Arrows can and will miss, so be sure to place your towers accordingly.

* Burn effect: Struck enemies will take additional burning damage over time for 2 seconds. If burned by towers of different strengths, the largest burn damage will be used for DoT and its duration will be refreshed.

* AI: Targets enemies that are not burning first.

After evolving, the fire tower DoT will last 4 seconds.
