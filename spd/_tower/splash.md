# Splash Tower

The best area of effect (AoE) tower in the game.

* Splash damage: A cannonball is launched and deals the same amount of damage to all nearby targets on impact.

* Arc projectiles: Cannonballs move at moderate speeds and can miss depending on the enemy movement.

* AI: Targets the closest enemy and focuses until out of range.

* Bouncing effect: If a cannonball hits a target, it can bounce depending on its level.
  * Each bounce deals 80% damage of the previous cannonball and has a 25% splash radius reduction.

At level 100, this tower will gain 20% range. Also, each cannonball bounce will no longer reduce in size increasing the chance of bouncing more!

At level 601, the splash tower will become invulnerable and each bounce will create 3 cannonballs instead of 1.
