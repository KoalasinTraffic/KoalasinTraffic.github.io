# Splash Tower

The best area of effect (AoE) tower in the game.

* Splash damage: A cannonball is launched and deals the same amount of damage to all nearby targets on impact.

* Arc projectiles: Cannonballs move at moderate speeds and will miss depending on the direction of the enemies.

* No status effects.

* AI: Targets the closest enemy and focuses it until out of range.

After evolving, the splash tower will have a second cannonball that bounces upon impact. The second cannonball does 25% of the original ball's damage.
