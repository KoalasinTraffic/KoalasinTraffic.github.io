# Basic Tower

The cheapest and most cost efficient tower in the game.

* Single damage: A single arrow is shot and deals damage to the first target it hits.

* Slow projectile: Arrows can and will miss, so be sure to place your towers in a strategic location.

* AI: Targets the closest enemy and focuses until out of range.

* No status effects.

After evolving, projectiles will grow over time and deal more damage the further away the target is (up to x2 damage). Additionally, the range of the basic tower is increased by 50%.
