# Basic Tower

The cheapest and most cost efficient tower in the game. It also has a fanning ability when leveled up.

* Single damage: An arrow is shot and deals damage to the first target it hits.
  * Starting at level 2, it will fan additional arrows depending on its level with 1/6th damage each.
  * The maximum number of arrows is 7.

* Slow projectile: Arrows can and will miss, so be sure to place your towers in a strategic location.

* AI: Targets the closest enemy and focuses until out of range.

* No status effects.

At level 8, the main arrow grows over time and deal more damage the further away the target is (up to x2 damage). Additionally, the range of the basic tower is increased by 80%.
