# Basic Tower

The cheapest and most effective tower in the game.

* Single damage: A single arrow is shot and deals damage to the first target it hits.

* Slow projectile: Arrows can and will miss, so be sure to place your towers accordingly.

* No status effects.

* AI: Targets the closest enemy and focuses it until out of range.

After evolving, the basic tower will deal more damage the further away the target is at impact (up to x2 damage). Additionally, the range of the basic tower is increased by 50%.
