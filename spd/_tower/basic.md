# Basic Tower

The cheapest and most cost efficient tower in the game. It also has a fanning ability when leveled up.

* Single damage: An arrow is shot and deals damage to the first target it hits.
  * At level 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100, an additional arrow will fan with 10% damage each.
  * At level 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600, two more arrows will fan.

* Slow projectile: Arrows can and will miss, so be sure to place your towers in a strategic location.

* AI: Targets the closest enemy and focuses until out of range.

* No status effects.

At level 100, the main arrow grows over time and deal more damage the further away the target is (up to x2 damage). Additionally, the range is increased by 80%.

At level 601, the basic tower will become invulnerable and fan 51 arrows.
