# Beam Tower

This tower creates a beam between itself and the nearest beam tower. With every level up, the beam tower will redo its tethering.

* Single damage: Damage is dealt when an enemy crosses the beam.

* No projectile: Beams remain as long as original tower does not die.
  * The number of beams depend on the tower's level, with a maximum of 8 beams.
  * Past level 8, upgrading this tower will still redo its tethering.

* AI: None

* Piercing effect: Enemies that are invulnerable can be damaged by piercing.

At level 8, beams will deal 1/6 of the tower's damage per second to all enemies that stay within the beam.
