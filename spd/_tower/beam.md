# Beam Tower

This tower creates a beam between itself and the nearest beam tower. With every level up, the beam tower will redo its tethering.

* Single damage: Damage is dealt when an enemy crosses the beam.

* No projectile: Beams remain as long as original tower does not die.
  * At level 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 601, an additional beam tether will be made.
  * Starting at level 100, beams will deal 10% damage to all enemies that stay within the beam every second.

* AI: None

* Piercing effect: Enemies that are invulnerable can be damaged by piercing.

The beam and wall towers are the only ones that can't be moved by bosses.

At level 601, the beam tower will become invulnerable and stun enemies on overlap.
