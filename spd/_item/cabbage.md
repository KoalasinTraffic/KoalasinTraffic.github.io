# Hidden Locations

Cabbages are found in any variation of the 3rd map. The easiest way to get all 7 is to search in Level 3E. Otherwise, it requires using a shore glitch to reach all locations.

1. Next to spawn.

2. Next to base between the tree and windmill.

3. Jump on boats to reach shore.

4. Jump on bridge to reach area.

5. Start from 4 and jump on boat to get around trees.

6. Jump on boat from base.

7. Start from 6, jump to shore, and go left along shore.
