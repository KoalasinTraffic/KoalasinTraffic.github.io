# A Twist On A Proven Classic

Small People Defense is a 3rd person real-time strategy tower defense game where you queue up your own difficulty. Challenge yourself by rushing incoming waves or simply enjoy powering up your *small person* into the largest in the world!

This twist on a proven classic allows for multiple viable strategies. There are benefits for those who specialize in single towers, but different enemies will require a diverse set of defenses.

Coming out in 2023!
