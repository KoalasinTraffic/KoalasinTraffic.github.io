# A Twist On A Proven Classic

[Small People Defense](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239870/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} is a beautiful 3rd-person tower defense game where you queue up your own difficulty. Challenge yourself in this real-time strategy TD game by rushing incoming waves to get bonus points. Or simply enjoy leveling up your *small person* into the largest in the world!

Explore the depth in strategy with enemy abilities, tower interactions, tower placements, and rushing waves. For example, the barbarian has a shield that's only breakable with a stun combo. To stun your foe, you must inflict the burning and slow status before striking it with lightning. Also, tower placements are key because slow projectiles will miss if enemies move away from your towers. Lastly, rushing enemy waves will starve your income but will grant significant bonus points. Don't get too greedy!

# Features

* Over 20 levels (each 3 to 15 minutes long with separate leaderboards)
* 4 challenging bosses
* Over 10 enemy types
* 4 unlockable items
* 6 upgradeable towers

This twist on a proven classic allows for multiple viable strategies. There are huge benefits for those who focus on leveling up a single tower, but enemies will require a diverse set of defenses. Power up your towers and use unlockable items to open the endless possibilities.
