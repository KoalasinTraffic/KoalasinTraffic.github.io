# A Twist On A Proven Classic

Small People Defense is a beautiful 3rd-person tower defense game where you queue up your own difficulty. Challenge yourself in this real-time strategy TD game by rushing incoming waves to get bonus points. Or simply enjoy leveling up your *small person* into the largest in the world!

This twist on a proven classic allows for multiple viable strategies. There are huge benefits for those who focus on leveling up a single tower, but enemies will require a diverse set of defenses. Power up your towers and use unlockable items to open the endless possibilities.

Small People Defense is organized into small 15-minute levels, which can be sped up for those looking for a challenge. There will be over 20 levels, each with their own leaderboards.
