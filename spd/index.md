# A Twist On A Proven Classic

Official website for [Small People Defense](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239870/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, an indie 3rd-person tower defense game where you queue up your own difficulty. Challenge yourself in this real-time strategy TD game by rushing incoming waves to get bonus points. Or simply enjoy leveling up your *small person* into the largest in the world!

Explore the depth in strategy with mechanics involving enemy abilities, tower interactions, tower placements, rushing waves, and more! For instance, the barbarian has a shield that's only breakable with a stun combo. To stun your foe, you must inflict the burning and slow status before striking it with lightning.

Also, tower placements are key because slow projectiles will miss if enemies move too fast. Upgrade your best placed towers to maximize your resources! And lastly, rushing enemy waves will starve your income but will grant significant bonus points. Don't get too greedy!

# Features

* Over 20 levels each 3 to 15 minutes long
* Endless mode, mazing levels, and leaderboards
* 6 towers with upgrades
* 4 unlockable items found within each biome
* Permanent power ups and easy level progression
* 6 challenging bosses
* Over 10 unique enemy types

This twist on a proven classic has many viable strategies. Although it is more cost efficient to focus on leveling up a single tower, enemies require a diverse set of defenses. Power up your towers and use unlockable items to open the endless possibilities!

# Coming Out April 14th!
